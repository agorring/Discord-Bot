# Discord-Bot

An intelligent Discord bot developed in Python

The bot must be added to a Discord server, and the server token pasted into the python file on line 94. The bot will come online when the file is run.

The bot responds to a variety of questions. It intelligently identifies the question being asked using the SequenceMatcher class.
